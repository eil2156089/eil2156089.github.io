<p> I'm a junior at Metro Tech high school. I am currently taking computer networking at Metro Tech. I plan to travel around the world and discover new cultures. I would like to go to ASU to major in Criminal Justice. I am here because I would like to learn new things so that I could apply it to other people.  </p>
